Epigraf
=======

Epigraf is a next-generation file management utility for data hoarders.

Features
--------

*Note: Epigraf is still in early alpha. Most of these are currently not implemented. Please view this as a roadmap/wishlist.*

One-stop-shop for all types of files.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Epigraf handles all kind of files, from pictures to music, videos, disc images, 3D models or ebooks.
When possible, Epigraf provides an internal viewer for the files, or allows you to open them with any external program available on your machine.

Integrated with your desktop.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Epigraf is multi-platform, but we try to play nice with what you already have. Epigraf will use all the tools and libraries available on your platform of choice to provide the best experience possible.

Easy tag system.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Epigraf manages files using tags and metadata, in a way similar to the popular boorus. This provides an easy way to describe the content of your files, to quickly find what you need, without the hassles of going through hundred of folders.

No need to change the way you organize your files.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Contrary to other available solutions, Epigraf keeps your files where they are. As a result, you are free to use any other software you want, like Plex, Kodi or Calibre.

Advanced duplicate files finder.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We know you don't keep track of what you have, so we'll do it for you. Epigraf can find duplicates using average hashing, perception hashing, difference hashing, wavelet hashing and regular cryptographic hashes.

Daemon-based file downloader.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Want to keep downloading all new files from an FTP ? Want to pillage a website of all its images or videos ?
Epigraf can run as a daemon to automatically keep track of subscriptions. It's also integrated with Youtube-dl and Streamlink to easily handle all video sites without slowing down development.

Community-contributed tagging.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Tagging hundreds of thousands of files can be time consuming and boring. So why not let the community do it for you ?
Epigraf provides a user-contributed database of file hashes and tags, to automatically describe the files you import. No personal data is shared with us, only the hash of the files and the tags associated with them.

Discover your content.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It can be hard to find new things if you download in bulk. To help you enjoy your data, Epigraf can generate collections based on tags and metadata.

Modern and future-proof.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Epigraf is based on modern technologies and strong standards. We try not to reinvent the wheel and we provide automated testing and building for all platforms we support.
